// Statements:
let x, y, z;    // Statement 1
x = 5;          // Statement 2
y = 6;          // Statement 3
z = x + y;      // Statement 4

// JavaScript Programs
// A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
// In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
// A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

// In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.

// JavaScript statements are composed of:
// Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

// This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":
document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Hello Dolly';

// Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.
// The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.

// Semicolons ;
// Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

// Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:
let a, b, c;    // Declare 3 variables
a = 5;          // Assign the value 5 to a
b = 6;          // Assign the value 6 to b
c = a + b;      // Assign the sum of a and b to c

// When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;

// JavaScript White Space
// JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

// The following lines are equivalent:
let person = 'Hege';
let person2='Hege';

// JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks
// For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

// If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:
document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 
'Hello Dolly!';

// JavaScript Code Blocks
// JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

// The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

// One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:
function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById('demo1').innerHTML = 'Hello there!';
    document.getElementById('demo2').innerHTML = 'How are you?';
}

// JavaScript Keywords
// JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

// Our Reserved Words Reference lists all JavaScript keywords.

// Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:
// var         	Declares a variable
// let         	Declares a block variable
// const       	Declares a block constant
// if          	Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
// switch       Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
// for         	Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
// function    	Declares a function
// return      	Exits a function
// try         	Implements error handling to a block of statements
